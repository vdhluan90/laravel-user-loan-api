This is a basic sample for writing Restful API projects using Laravel with requirement:

- Build a simple API that allows to handle user loans.
- Necessary entities will have to be (but not limited to): users, loans, and repayments.
- The API should allow simple use cases, which include (but are not limited to): creating a new
user, creating a new loan for a user, with different attributes (e.g. duration, repayment
frequency, interest rate, arrangement fee, etc.), and allowing a user to make repayments for
the loan.
- The app logic should figure out and not allow obvious errors. For example a user cannot
make a repayment for a loan thatâ€™s already been prepaid
